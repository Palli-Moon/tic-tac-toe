Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

A little tic-tac-toe game made using ncurses

The game is now playable! You just have to use your imagination and keep score yourself. `Ctrl-C` closes the game when you have finished and you can reopen it with `./tictactoe` to go again (assuming you're in the Tic-Tac-Toe directory ofcourse.) Soon I will implement a feature where the game recognises which player has won and asks you if you want to play again.

The game will only compile on a unix system, and needs to have ncurses installed. To compile use `make` or use the `-lncurses` flag.
